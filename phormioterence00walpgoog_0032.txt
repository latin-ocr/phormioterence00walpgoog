at the end of the play is induced by hie good-nature to

Beyond this,it is hard to take exception to the character·

no one could be so utter a monomaniac or so distreus

their· position: their language is too polished and their
manners unnaturally gentlemanly: but slaves were
not always of low birth, and the particular class de
picted in Terence is that of the master's confidant.

The effect ol these sketches, so far as they achieved
anything beyond amusement sor the honr, Prolata w

which pervedes the comedies, and in the representa·
tion oi slave lise a hint of something still higher‚ an
inducement to gentleness and humanity. Butin the
main the tendency, we cannot but sear, was downwards
rather than upwards; vice is there though itis more

refined than that to which the Romans were as yet
