xviii P. PERENTI PHORMIO.

so long as youth tries to enjoy itself, parents are
anxious, old men querulons and unreesonable, women
reductive, parasitos fawning and servants impudent,
Menander and his imitatore will survive. An eye for
character, the kneok of life-like portraiture; these
Menander had; and besides these the enain of pen-
