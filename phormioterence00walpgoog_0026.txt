best and least slavish of interpretem. The voice cf

criticisms the most famous is that of Julius Caesar,
who addressce him ae ‘dimidiate Menander ', and de-
plores only hie want of vigonr and ccmic power⁹⁰.

In this last respect we doubt whether Terence has
received full justice: it is true that there vocamen
is occasionally a tarneness in some cf his dialogues3

a consequent deficiency in comio action: it is true
that he was not a perfect Menander, and could not
combine richness of humour with severity of language.
In the former point Plautus is perhaps his superior,
but his language is often extravagant: he makes ecn-
tinuel pune (a practice rare with Terence)³⁰; he piles
epithet upon epithet in his more animated soenes cs
abuse: he is full ct' burlesque and pantomime‚ repartee
