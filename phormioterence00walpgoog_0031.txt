xxiv P. serrari PHORMJO.

courtesan, parasite, dic, who are presented to us⁴⁸.
To accomplish this with success it is necessary that
each character be drawn out consistently with itself
and true to the principa] lines of real liic. Taking the
Phormio as illustrativa we see Dorio representing tha
ordinary slavedealer, blunt, decided, bullying, a keen
