being brought ont after his death] or with the combi-

nation of learning and of opportunities would douhtless
have anticipated much of what Bentley afterwards
accomplished.

Gupet, 1657, was agend scholar, but too ready to
eut difficolt knots hy saying that verses are corrept⁵¹‚
and shewed a werpr perverted judgment in condemning
the latter part oi the Phormio.

Riclosrd Bentley [London, 1726,Αο101001010, 1727]
‘summus ille Terenti sospitator, inter medendum idem

of Terentiam criticism, and though he gave too much

during the next century.

A. Fleckeisen, 1857, edited the text, promising a

siderable scope was given to conjecture. But the
work as a whole was a decided advance.

W. Wagner, 1869, trod closely in the footsteps 01
Fleckeisen, but 001 without some improvements. He
however (like most preceding editors) had not an
