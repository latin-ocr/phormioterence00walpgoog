xx I'. TERENTI PHORMIO.

effect Terence is undoubtedly wanting: on the other
hand hc fairly fultilsthe definition os wit ‘chasteued
insolence’‚ as given by Aristotle⁸²: his humour con·
'sista in contrast oi character rather than in exuberant
fun such as characterises the farcical imitation oi
Moliereffl. There is however plenty of briskness and
life in the Eumachus (what can be more entertsining

ot simplicity by the custom of contaminatio already
alluded te. The use of two or more plays to construet
oue produces a want of unity in the plot: and this is
objectionable‚ because is the principal plot is first
evolved, the rest of the play is uninteresting; is the
