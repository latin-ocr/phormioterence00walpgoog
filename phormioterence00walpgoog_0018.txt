’ INTRODUOTION. . xi

Slaves in those times were osten of gentler birch end
vvider culture than their masters: but judgingfrem the
extreme purity of his labinity, nnobscured and unde
filed by any brace of barbarism, ic seems likely thar
Terence was brought ever in his early childhoed: he
therefore owed te his master his liberal edueetion,
granted doubtless all the more freely that he gave
boken ef future greatness. Admithed lo the society
and close friendship of Scipio and Iaelins and other
patrona ei mark he had every opportunity for en-
larging his culture and achieving drsmaiio success.
Detraetors were noh wanting to pub the most dis·
hononrable sense en this attachment of the greab3
¹others, again, tried lo reb the dramatici ef his well-
earned laureis by insinuating that the werke iasued in
Terence's name were nob absolutely his own, but that
he received material assistance in their composition
from his patrona. The poet himself seems to allow
that there was some foundation fer this charge, in the
prologus to one of his play ¹⁰:- ’
quod illi maeniorumoimau aare echtuneeet
cam leudem hic decirmocemcm, quom illis placet
qui nobis uniuersis et popule placent,

quornm opera in belle ie etio in neyotio. ·
ovo quisque tempere usust εἰπε superbia.

It is impossible to believe that these words ef high
praise can have been applied be laelius and Scipio, as
ab that daie they hardly deservcd them: further, if we
adopt the earlier daie fer Terence's birth, these patrone
were his juniora, and therefore unable or unlikely bo
have helped him. sein the evidence is unmisbakeable
that he received some extraneeus help.

Six comedies have come down ie ns: the Andria,
Eunuchus, Hcemomimemmenos, Phormio, nawen.
